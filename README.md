# credit-card-fraud-detection

This repository contains Jupyter notebook which illustrates use of knn algorithm to detect credit card fraud detection dependant on card present and card not present scenario. The dataset used is extracted from Kaggle. 

More than 5 million data are stolen every day, according to the Data Breach Index, a worrying statistic that demonstrates fraud is still prevalent for both Card-Present and Card-not Present type of payments. Fraud detection is difficult in today's digital world, when trillions of Card transactions occur every day.
